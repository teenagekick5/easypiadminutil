Easy Pi Administration Utility

This is my easy admin tool for the Raspberry Pi and linux and is used from the terminal

This program runs commands as sudo so, as with anything you download from the internet please read through the source code to see that i am not doing anything i shouldn't be

To keep this file small i have not included all the needed files, primarily the raspbian images..

you will need to download these from the foundation website, then please rename them wheezy.img jessie.img and jessielite.img and store them in the folder /PiScripts/PiStuff

if you do not want to use all the images thats fine, just download the one you want and rename that

to use the script simply navigate to the folder you saved it in and run ./pi
